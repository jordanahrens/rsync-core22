summary: Utility for transferring and synchronizing files between computers and drives
description: |
  Rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files
  between a computer and a storage drive and across networked computers by
  comparing the modification times and sizes of files.

  **This snap is intended primarily for use with Ubuntu Core.  Unless you have
  a compelling reason otherwise, you should install rsync from your distro's
  repo.**

  Once installed, you'll want to create an alias so rsync can function properly
  when receiving files from other machines:

  `sudo snap alias rsync-core22.rsync rsync`

  And then you'll probably want to enable the _optional_ extra plugs to access
  files outside the snap's sandbox:

  `sudo snap connect rsync-core22:home`
  `sudo snap connect rsync-core22:removable-media`

  This snap is maintained by the community, and is not endorsed or officially
  maintained by the upstream developers.
